Follow these instructions in order to execute our system:

Use RStudio Version 0.99.491 integrated with R Version 3.2.3
The code for water,air and soil are placed in 'water.txt','air.txt' and 'soil.txt' of Water,Air and Soil directories respectively.

Open RStudio
For Water,
1> Import Dataset from a text file water-treatment.data
2> Copy and paste the code from water.txt file in order to get the local decision of water.

For Air,
3> Import Dataset from a text file airdata.csv
4> Copy and paste the code from air.txt file in order to get the local decision of air.

For Soil,
5> Import Dataset from a text file soildata.csv
6> Copy and paste the code from soil.txt file in order to get the local decision of soil.

In order to arrive at the final decision tree,
7> Import Datasets from the text files 'rfsvm4.csv','chinb2.csv' and 'rfetem1.csv'.
8>Copy and paste the code from finaldecision.txt file in order to get the final decision of all three sources whether the water can be used for domestic puposes or not.
